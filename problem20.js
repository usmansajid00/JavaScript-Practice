// You are developing an online event booking system for a theater. The system needs to check
//  seat availability and book a seat for a customer.
//
// Requirements:
//
// If a seat is available, book it and confirm the booking.
// If a seat is already booked, notify the user.
// Ensure that the same seat cannot be booked twice.
